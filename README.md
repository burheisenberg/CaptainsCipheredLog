# CaptainsCipheredLog
A JavaFX project intended to record dailybooks

Compilation advice: The project has been written on JetBrains Intellij IDE. Before compiling, download the JavaFX library and import it. Download it from here: https://openjfx.io/. The code uses modules, which comes with Java 9+, so it is recommended to use Java SE. You can download it from here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html. In order to compile a double-clickable jar file, create and artifact from Intellij and add .dll files (for Windows) or .so files (for Linux/Mac) into artifact. Finally, build artifact.

Usage: In the first opening, you should create a new user with new username and password. Afterwards, you can create, edit or delete logs. After the first opening, two files named usersFile.ccl and dailyBooks.ccl are created. They are the storage files. NEVER DELETE THOSE! 

Further improvements: An icon may be add. GUI and encryption technique (Caesar ciphering) may be improved.
